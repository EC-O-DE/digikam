Sorry that I need to use this route! pardon me. This is crucial: digiKam context menu needs one utem where would open/change context menu to Win Explorer context menu.
Many people especially professionals have WE/FE context menu abundunt of useful commands for programs - all that missing in digiKam.
I think ADB Bridge had that, haven't used it in such a long time.
UltraEdit does have that - it's such a relief when one can use the app's own context menu and Explorer context menu inside an app.
